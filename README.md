# Internal Content Analytics

By optimizing content we remove one kind of bottleneck in an organization - knowledge transfer. It may be that something other than knowledge is limiting your organization, so you should analyze the business with at least a qualitative eye to confirm that content is a productive place to invest, before you invest in it. It may be that you have bigger priorities in management practices, incentives, or tools. Very often, however, knowledge transfer is at least one of your bottlenecks.

Use the procedures, tips, and code samples in this repository to get actionable insights from content on internal platforms. The content may be published on an intranet or wiki, posted to a file share, or created by the community through enterprise social media. 

The insights from these analytics will lead to 
* greater efficiency
* better collaboration

###Content Platforms
Platforms for internal content come in many forms. We'll look at some of these:

|Tool                   | Content                                         |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|Atlassian Confluence   | Wiki pages, wiki comments, file lists, meeting notes|
|Atlassian JIRA         | The bodies of tickets often contain the bulk of a company's content, especially in an engineering organization|
|Slack                  | Though it's minimally structured and not designed for analytics, a chat platform like Slack can perform like Facebook to identify mood, influencers, and unanswered questions|
|Yammer                 | Like Slack, Yammer can become an alternative to email that ends up storing most of the text output of a company|
