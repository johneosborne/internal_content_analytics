# Internal Content Analytics

By optimizing content we remove one kind of bottleneck in an organization - knowledge transfer. It may be that something other than knowledge is limiting your organization, so you should analyze the business with at least a qualitative eye to confirm that content is a productive place to invest, before you invest in it. It may be that you have bigger priorities in management practices, incentives, or tools. Very often, however, knowledge transfer is at least one of your bottlenecks.
